- title: Best decision ever!
  quote: My dream to become a developer has already come true... I got a job as a junior developer before I graduated and started to work the day after graduation. As for landing that job one of the most important factors my employer saw in my experience was good coding habits, to work well under pressure and in a team. My employer is very impressed by how much you can learn in 12 weeks of this bootcamp.

  quote: The experience at Craft Academy was life changing for me, learning web & mobile development using test driven and behavioural approach. The anthem at Craft Academy is "Agile Software Development, TDD & BDD". Well structured path of learning. Great course content material. From day one of resuming the camp, you start coding right away. You have no choice, you just have to code, code, code, code daily.

  quote: In the last half of the camp, we built some applications that impressed the crap out of our friends - a simple social network, an online marketplace for placing food orders, an interactive pub quiz app that pushes out questions in real time to players, and receives their answers back. I'm really proud of what we built during those last six weeks.
